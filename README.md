# Mostly Printed Linear Actuator Project

The goal of this project is to design a mostly printed bearing that can be used on a Mostly Printed 3D printer.

### Design Level #1
PTFE Inserted Bearing<br/>
This version uses PTFE Tube otherwise known as Bowden tube as a bearing surface.  It worked good in initial testing but failed quickly after adding a load to the bearing. <br/>
(obsoleted)<br/>

### Design Level #2<br/>
Dovetail Guided Actuator<br/>
This version utilizes a nylon filament from Jabil with a low friction addative.<br/>
